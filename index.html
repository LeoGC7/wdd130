            <p>Hello! My name is Leonardo Correa and I'm from Londrina, Brazil. I'm currently living in SÃ£o Paulo, I'm 22 years old
                and I like to play videogames and play musical instruments. I served a mission in JoÃ£o Pessoa-PB, from March 2022 to October 2023.
                I have a younger brother who is 13, and a dog named Sirius. During my entire life I always wanted to enter in a medicine school, but during
                my mission I did the BYU-Pathway program and chose the Introduction to Programming certificate and I discovered what I really liked to do.
                I decided to continue my graduation in the area of programming by BYU-Idaho. Although I love the medical area, I'm very familiarized with 
                computers and technology stuff. Changing my area of work was a great decision! 
            </p>
